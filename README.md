# PizzaBot

This is a dialogFlow bot made to recieve pizza orders.  

I have used dialogFlow platform to take customers orders and i have made a server using ExpressJs which entertains the webhook call by dialogFlow intent.

In this server i have integerated functionalities like save the order to DB (MongoDB), confirm customer order and send custom responses to user.

I have used Telegram integration in this chatbot.

You can test it from [Here](https://t.me/Pizza_17Bot).
